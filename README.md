Chomp — game by Micaelee Hanson mhanson@ecuad.ca 

Try to eat as many donuts and tacos as possible but avoid eating the shoes and fish bones! 
Player’s physical movements control the motion of an animated mouth within the game, which 
must be carefully maneuvered to eat the food.  Chomp uses Kyle Macdonald’s FaceOSC app to 
track the coordinates of the players mouth within the screen, and this data is sent to 
Processing and used to animate the cartoon mouth. Eating a donut or taco adds a point to 
the players score, but you can quickly lose points by eating shoes and fish bones. To win 
this two-player game, players must quickly eat enough to reach eight points before their 
opponent.
